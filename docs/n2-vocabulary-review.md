# N2 vocabulary expansion and review ledger

## Status

**Batches 01-02 review-closed; expansion in progress.** The target is all 1,812 source rows,
not 1,812 necessarily distinct new articles. The [source index](n2-vocabulary-sources.tsv)
preserves every row; empty teaching columns mean the mapping has not yet been established.
The first 40 rows are review-closed; 1,772 remain pending.

Baseline: `f1a93f249b78ae87c8233da1fbb48e92f02d4b44` on the local
`jlpt-n2-vocabulary` branch. The completed kanji work is separately pushed as
[`jlpt-n2-kanji`](https://github.com/stop-cran/learning-japanese/tree/jlpt-n2-kanji).

See the [plan and authoring notes](n2-vocabulary-notes.md) and
[pinned source snapshot](n2-vocabulary-snapshot.json).

## Coverage states

- `pending`: original row inventoried; no reviewed teaching mapping claimed.
- `draft`: article and selected evidence exist, but independent review/reconciliation is incomplete.
- `closed`: independent GPT and Claude reviews and evidence-based reconciliation are recorded.
- `unresolved`: a consequential mapping or teaching question remains open; never counted as closed.

Rows may share an article but retain their own status, source identity, selected senses and notes.
`article_level` is the actual article's easiest sourced level, not a replacement for source N2.
Planning batch numbers are scheduling aids, not claims that a batch has been authored.

## Batch 01: N2:2-N2:21

**Status:** closed after independent initial reviews, corrections and bounded confirmation.

Scope: あいかわらず, アイデア, アイディア, 曖昧, 遭う, 扇ぐ, 青白い,
あかんぼう, 明き, あきれる, アクセント, 欠伸, 飽くまで, 明け方, 揚げる,
挙げる, 憧れる, 足跡, 味わう, 預かる.

The draft adds **17 articles** and reuses `会う` (N5), `赤ん坊` (N4), and `空き` (N3).
The first two already teach the applicable source identities; `空き` gains explicit `明き`
alias teaching without changing its stable written form, primary reading, or level.
The collection now contains 3,290 word articles.

The [batch evidence](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-01.json) preserves the original rows,
selected mappings, complete relevant JMdict entry families and component evidence.
Ten existing kanji pages gain useful links, including reciprocal N2 links for
`伸`/`欠伸`, `跡`/`足跡`, and `預`/`預かる`. The existing `預ける` comparison gains a word link.

### Initial review

Both reviewers examined committed snapshot
`fe744d204feaeb554fce6df934cfafed81419be5`, parent
`94a175cdc06f3c7d1d09cbd8891b2a5ef370b18f`, with the same scope, rubric and source access.
They ran in separate short-lived processes, sequentially, with no nested agents or file edits.
The first process exited before the second began. Usage receipts verified the actual models:

- [GPT report](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-01-gpt-initial.md): `gpt-6.1-sol`.
- [Claude report](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-01-claude-initial.md): `claude-opus-5.5`.

All 17 new articles received three-facet verdicts. Both also assessed the changed passages,
the explicit 明き reuse, and the narrow unchanged 会う/赤ん坊 coverage claims.
The file-only reviewers could not independently run Git or verify frozen hashes; their reports
disclose that limit. The author checked the clean committed snapshot and exact changed-file scope.

### Reconciliation

The following changes are implemented and confirmed on the corrected snapshot:

| Initial finding | Decision and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| GPT F01 / Claude F1: あきれる and うんざり | Add their direct exclusion. Entry 1515580 sense 1 and the two actual articles teach the same "fed up" use. |
| GPT F02: 挙げる and 示す/収める/得る | Add all three direct exclusions. Entry 2864818 senses 1 and 11 explicitly cover showing examples and achieving/obtaining; the comparison articles' displayed labels overlap. |
| GPT F03: 味わう and 味 | Add a direct exclusion for the English "taste" ambiguity without changing the established noun label or pretending the Japanese noun and verb are interchangeable. |
| GPT F04: 曖昧 and 疑わしい | Add a direct exclusion for the separate suspicious/disreputable sense. Entry 1567920 sense 2 and Seisenban Nihon Kokugo Daijiten's 曖昧 sense 3 support the overlap; neither establishes its frequency or an independent N2 level. |
| GPT F05 / Claude Optional: missing navigation | Link 相 at the introduced spelling 相変わらず (shared observation); also link 示す in the explicit comparison (GPT-only observation). Keep kana-headword metadata unchanged. |
| Claude F2 and its weaker optional 普段 candidate | Add direct pairs with いつも and 普段 after inspecting their actual labels and complete entries 1188890 and 1497180. Their usual/habitual/always senses overlap the source entry's "as usual/as always" labels. This is not transitive inference through an existing exclusion. |
| Claude F3: 飽くまで wording | Clarify the mnemonic warning and identify あくまで, not an English gloss, as the potential mistaken substitute for やはり. Treat this as a clarity improvement: the original "not ... in every sentence" did not itself establish a false historical or modern meaning. |

The supplemental comparison entries and the exact external dictionary check are retained in the
[batch evidence](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-01.json). None of these changes alters the
original source fields, stable existing identities, readings or easier levels.

Optional expansions were not required for closure: more spellings/homophones for 扇ぐ, a figurative
そくせき lesson, a set phrase for あきれる, alternative 味わう examples, and dash style.
The suggested アイディア spelling-note polish is also optional. Counts of priority tags are not
used as a measured ranking of spelling frequency.

### Confirmation and closure

Both original model families independently checked correction commit
`2ca51500880851eae1d5cd3e6eef9ff7165d1329`, parent
`fe744d204feaeb554fce6df934cfafed81419be5`, against the actual six-article correction diff.
Each received only its own initial report, with the same bounded scope and source access:
eight direct exclusions, two navigation links and two clarified warnings. Neither received
the other review or the author's adjudication. GPT exited before Claude started; usage
receipts confirmed the requested models and no file edits.

- [GPT confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-01-gpt-confirmation.md):
  `gpt-6.1-sol`; initial F01-F05 resolved, all six changed-passage verdicts CLEAN.
- [Claude confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-01-claude-confirmation.md):
  `claude-opus-5.5`; initial F1-F3 resolved, all six changed-passage verdicts CLEAN.

Both found no actionable regression or consequential unresolved claim in the assigned changes.
The original whole-article verdicts and these bounded confirmations together support closure;
confirmation is not represented as a new full-pilot review. Their file-only Git/hash and
unexecuted-runtime limits remain explicit in the reports. The author verified the committed
snapshot, source/index integrity, baseline preservation and reciprocal links separately.

Claude's remaining wording polish for 飽くまで and optional 相 reading, comparison candidates
たいてい/普通, set phrase and alternative example are nonblocking suggestions. They do not
establish a defect in the reviewed snapshot and were not added merely to prolong review.
The first 20 source rows and batch evidence are now marked closed.

### Usefulness of two model families

The reports overlapped on the fed-up quiz collision and the 相 link, including Claude's Optional
section; those are not unique discoveries. GPT additionally identified the example/achievement,
taste-label and suspicious-sense collisions and the 示す link. Claude additionally identified the
habitual-adverb candidates and prompted clearer 飽くまで wording. The second review therefore
added useful signal on this shared pilot, but the sample is not a model ranking or proof of
exhaustive quiz-pair coverage. Severity differences were adjudicated by learning impact, not votes.

## Batch 02: N2:22-N2:41

**Status:** review-closed after sequential changed-passage confirmation.

Scope: 暖まる, 暖める, あたりまえ, あちらこちら, 厚かましい, 圧縮, 宛名,
あてはまる, あてはめる, 暴れる, 脂, あぶる, あふれる, 雨戸, 甘やかす, 余る,
編物, 編む, 危うい, 怪しい.

The batch adds **14 articles** and reuses six: あちこち (N3, explicitly teaching
あちらこちら), 怪しい (N2), and previously vocabulary-unclassified 暴れる, 脂, 余る
and 編む. Only the latter four gain explicit N2 metadata from these verified source rows;
their teaching text, stable identities and primary readings are unchanged.
No harder kanji-derived fallback is treated as vocabulary provenance.

The [batch evidence](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-02.json) retains the exact rows,
complete relevant dictionary families, restrictions and component evidence.
Ten existing kanji pages gain useful word links or examples. Reciprocal N2 links cover
厚/厚かましい, 圧/圧縮, 戸/雨戸, 甘/甘やかす and 編/編物; 温 also links the explicitly
taught 温まる/温める spellings to the new 暖まる/暖める articles.
The collection now contains 3,304 word articles. All 20 rows in this batch are review-closed.

### Initial review and reconciliation

Both reviewers independently read authored snapshot
`a0423388624ed50b0a348ad6f7dd7c212b3850b9` with the same assignment and evidence:
all 14 new articles, the actual ten-kanji/four-level-only diff and six narrow reuse claims.
The isolated `gpt-6.1-sol` process fully exited before `claude-opus-5.5` started.
Usage receipts verify those actual models and zero file edits; the author checked the clean
unchanged snapshot between runs.

Reports are archived without rewriting:
[GPT initial](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-02-gpt-initial.md) and
[Claude initial](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-02-claude-initial.md).
Both found the source mappings, related kanji passages and six reuse claims covered.

| Finding | Disposition | Evidence and change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT B02-GPT-01 / Claude B02-CL-01 | Resolved; confirmed | あてはめる and 適用 both teach applying a rule to a case. Add the direct guard and comparison link. This is one shared finding, not two independent defects. |
| GPT B02-GPT-02 | Resolved; confirmed | 宛名 explicitly includes the recipient's name alone. Add direct guards against 名前 and 名, plus a qualified comparison; the existing 名/名前 guard is not transitive. |
| Claude B02-CL-02 | Resolved; confirmed | あたりまえでしょう is taught as "of course," also もちろん's displayed label. Add that direct guard and link without claiming unrestricted grammatical substitution. |
| Claude B02-CL-03 | Guidance gap resolved; unsupported body preference withdrawn | Inspect the actual official 2014 PDF, entry 007, which covers both verbs as well as adjectives. Add qualified room/air versus food/drink spelling guidance and examples of 温. The body/hand spelling preference was not established by this source: replace those examples without declaring their former spelling wrong or asserting an exclusive body rule. |

The four direct quiz guards address localized answer ambiguity; they are treated as minor
editorial defects rather than general quiz failure. The spelling issue is missing contextual
guidance, not an established false dictionary spelling. The supplementary
`reviewEvidence` retains complete comparison entry families, the inspected PDF's hash,
exact location and the body/hand limitation.

**Optional, not blocking:** broader 危うい constructions/register, additional figurative overflow,
編み物 frequency guidance, あちらこちら register, a transitive title paraphrase and other prose polish.
No frequency claim is added from a dictionary spelling list alone. The 温 card's "also teaches"
links already identify the destination spelling; reversing that wording is not necessary for correctness.

**Model-usefulness note:** both found あてはめる/適用. GPT uniquely identified the two missing
recipient-name guards. Claude uniquely identified the "of course" label guard and the actionable
暖/温 guidance gap, while its proposed body-specific preference exceeded the inspected evidence.
These observations include the reports' optional notes and limits; they are shared-sample evidence
for complementary review signal, not a ranking or proof of exhaustive coverage.

### Changed-passage confirmation

Correction snapshot: `ae22a9861e76507bf8080c062b85a587c1ddaddd`, with the actual five-file
diff and each model's own initial report. Fresh bounded `gpt-6.1-sol` and `claude-opus-5.5`
processes ran sequentially on that unchanged clean snapshot and exited with zero file edits.
Both found all five changed article contexts **CLEAN / CLEAN / CLEAN** for correctness,
scoped coverage and comprehensibility; no actionable regression or consequential unresolved
claim remained in those passages.

[GPT confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-02-gpt-confirmation.md) resolves both original
GPT findings. [Claude confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-02-claude-confirmation.md)
resolves all three original Claude findings, explicitly withdraws the unverified body-spelling
guess and supports the additional 宛名 guards. Remaining suggestions about example sequencing,
kana presentation, explanatory wording and grammatical detail are optional, not new defects.
The body/hand preference remains unestablished but is no longer asserted by these cards.

Limits: file-only reviewers relied on author-verified snapshot/hash receipts and the supplied
short extract from the inspected official PDF; neither independently parsed that PDF or ran
the app. Closure is scoped editorial acceptance, not a native-speaker or whole-corpus guarantee.
The mechanical audit preserves all 3,273 baseline identities/readings/titles/exclusions and
established levels, separately recording the four source-backed formerly absent levels.
Validation reports zero errors; manifest generation is deterministic at `275a7b984b18b4c8`.
Coverage is **40 closed, 0 draft, 1,772 pending, 0 unresolved**: 31 new and nine reused articles.

## Final verification

Not started. Final closure requires all original rows accounted for, no consequential unresolved
claims, independent review coverage of every addition and changed passage, baseline preservation,
source/reading/sense and cross-reference audits, a deterministic manifest, and `stop-cran` authorship.
