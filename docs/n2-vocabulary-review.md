# N2 vocabulary expansion and review ledger

## Status

**Batches 01-04 review-closed; expansion in progress.** The target is all 1,812 source rows,
not 1,812 necessarily distinct new articles. The [source index](n2-vocabulary-sources.tsv)
preserves every row; empty teaching columns mean the mapping has not yet been established.
The first 80 rows are review-closed; 20 are drafted and 1,712 remain pending.

Baseline: `f1a93f249b78ae87c8233da1fbb48e92f02d4b44` on the local
`jlpt-n2-vocabulary` branch. The completed kanji work is separately pushed as
[`jlpt-n2-kanji`](https://github.com/stop-cran/learning-japanese/tree/jlpt-n2-kanji).

See the [plan and authoring notes](n2-vocabulary-notes.md) and
[pinned source snapshot](n2-vocabulary-snapshot.json).

## Coverage states

- `pending`: original row inventoried; no reviewed teaching mapping claimed.
- `draft`: article and selected evidence exist, but independent review/reconciliation is incomplete.
- `closed`: independent GPT and Claude reviews and evidence-based reconciliation are recorded.
- `unresolved`: a consequential mapping or teaching question remains open; never counted as closed.

Rows may share an article but retain their own status, source identity, selected senses and notes.
`article_level` is the actual article's easiest sourced level, not a replacement for source N2.
Planning batch numbers are scheduling aids, not claims that a batch has been authored.

## Batch 01: N2:2-N2:21

**Status:** closed after independent initial reviews, corrections and bounded confirmation.

Scope: あいかわらず, アイデア, アイディア, 曖昧, 遭う, 扇ぐ, 青白い,
あかんぼう, 明き, あきれる, アクセント, 欠伸, 飽くまで, 明け方, 揚げる,
挙げる, 憧れる, 足跡, 味わう, 預かる.

The draft adds **17 articles** and reuses `会う` (N5), `赤ん坊` (N4), and `空き` (N3).
The first two already teach the applicable source identities; `空き` gains explicit `明き`
alias teaching without changing its stable written form, primary reading, or level.
The collection now contains 3,290 word articles.

The [batch evidence](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-01.json) preserves the original rows,
selected mappings, complete relevant JMdict entry families and component evidence.
Ten existing kanji pages gain useful links, including reciprocal N2 links for
`伸`/`欠伸`, `跡`/`足跡`, and `預`/`預かる`. The existing `預ける` comparison gains a word link.

### Initial review

Both reviewers examined committed snapshot
`fe744d204feaeb554fce6df934cfafed81419be5`, parent
`94a175cdc06f3c7d1d09cbd8891b2a5ef370b18f`, with the same scope, rubric and source access.
They ran in separate short-lived processes, sequentially, with no nested agents or file edits.
The first process exited before the second began. Usage receipts verified the actual models:

- [GPT report](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-01-gpt-initial.md): `gpt-6.1-sol`.
- [Claude report](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-01-claude-initial.md): `claude-opus-5.5`.

All 17 new articles received three-facet verdicts. Both also assessed the changed passages,
the explicit 明き reuse, and the narrow unchanged 会う/赤ん坊 coverage claims.
The file-only reviewers could not independently run Git or verify frozen hashes; their reports
disclose that limit. The author checked the clean committed snapshot and exact changed-file scope.

### Reconciliation

The following changes are implemented and confirmed on the corrected snapshot:

| Initial finding | Decision and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| GPT F01 / Claude F1: あきれる and うんざり | Add their direct exclusion. Entry 1515580 sense 1 and the two actual articles teach the same "fed up" use. |
| GPT F02: 挙げる and 示す/収める/得る | Add all three direct exclusions. Entry 2864818 senses 1 and 11 explicitly cover showing examples and achieving/obtaining; the comparison articles' displayed labels overlap. |
| GPT F03: 味わう and 味 | Add a direct exclusion for the English "taste" ambiguity without changing the established noun label or pretending the Japanese noun and verb are interchangeable. |
| GPT F04: 曖昧 and 疑わしい | Add a direct exclusion for the separate suspicious/disreputable sense. Entry 1567920 sense 2 and Seisenban Nihon Kokugo Daijiten's 曖昧 sense 3 support the overlap; neither establishes its frequency or an independent N2 level. |
| GPT F05 / Claude Optional: missing navigation | Link 相 at the introduced spelling 相変わらず (shared observation); also link 示す in the explicit comparison (GPT-only observation). Keep kana-headword metadata unchanged. |
| Claude F2 and its weaker optional 普段 candidate | Add direct pairs with いつも and 普段 after inspecting their actual labels and complete entries 1188890 and 1497180. Their usual/habitual/always senses overlap the source entry's "as usual/as always" labels. This is not transitive inference through an existing exclusion. |
| Claude F3: 飽くまで wording | Clarify the mnemonic warning and identify あくまで, not an English gloss, as the potential mistaken substitute for やはり. Treat this as a clarity improvement: the original "not ... in every sentence" did not itself establish a false historical or modern meaning. |

The supplemental comparison entries and the exact external dictionary check are retained in the
[batch evidence](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-01.json). None of these changes alters the
original source fields, stable existing identities, readings or easier levels.

Optional expansions were not required for closure: more spellings/homophones for 扇ぐ, a figurative
そくせき lesson, a set phrase for あきれる, alternative 味わう examples, and dash style.
The suggested アイディア spelling-note polish is also optional. Counts of priority tags are not
used as a measured ranking of spelling frequency.

### Confirmation and closure

Both original model families independently checked correction commit
`2ca51500880851eae1d5cd3e6eef9ff7165d1329`, parent
`fe744d204feaeb554fce6df934cfafed81419be5`, against the actual six-article correction diff.
Each received only its own initial report, with the same bounded scope and source access:
eight direct exclusions, two navigation links and two clarified warnings. Neither received
the other review or the author's adjudication. GPT exited before Claude started; usage
receipts confirmed the requested models and no file edits.

- [GPT confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-01-gpt-confirmation.md):
  `gpt-6.1-sol`; initial F01-F05 resolved, all six changed-passage verdicts CLEAN.
- [Claude confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-01-claude-confirmation.md):
  `claude-opus-5.5`; initial F1-F3 resolved, all six changed-passage verdicts CLEAN.

Both found no actionable regression or consequential unresolved claim in the assigned changes.
The original whole-article verdicts and these bounded confirmations together support closure;
confirmation is not represented as a new full-pilot review. Their file-only Git/hash and
unexecuted-runtime limits remain explicit in the reports. The author verified the committed
snapshot, source/index integrity, baseline preservation and reciprocal links separately.

Claude's remaining wording polish for 飽くまで and optional 相 reading, comparison candidates
たいてい/普通, set phrase and alternative example are nonblocking suggestions. They do not
establish a defect in the reviewed snapshot and were not added merely to prolong review.
The first 20 source rows and batch evidence are now marked closed.

### Usefulness of two model families

The reports overlapped on the fed-up quiz collision and the 相 link, including Claude's Optional
section; those are not unique discoveries. GPT additionally identified the example/achievement,
taste-label and suspicious-sense collisions and the 示す link. Claude additionally identified the
habitual-adverb candidates and prompted clearer 飽くまで wording. The second review therefore
added useful signal on this shared pilot, but the sample is not a model ranking or proof of
exhaustive quiz-pair coverage. Severity differences were adjudicated by learning impact, not votes.

## Batch 02: N2:22-N2:41

**Status:** review-closed after sequential changed-passage confirmation.

Scope: 暖まる, 暖める, あたりまえ, あちらこちら, 厚かましい, 圧縮, 宛名,
あてはまる, あてはめる, 暴れる, 脂, あぶる, あふれる, 雨戸, 甘やかす, 余る,
編物, 編む, 危うい, 怪しい.

The batch adds **14 articles** and reuses six: あちこち (N3, explicitly teaching
あちらこちら), 怪しい (N2), and previously vocabulary-unclassified 暴れる, 脂, 余る
and 編む. Only the latter four gain explicit N2 metadata from these verified source rows;
their teaching text, stable identities and primary readings are unchanged.
No harder kanji-derived fallback is treated as vocabulary provenance.

The [batch evidence](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-02.json) retains the exact rows,
complete relevant dictionary families, restrictions and component evidence.
Ten existing kanji pages gain useful word links or examples. Reciprocal N2 links cover
厚/厚かましい, 圧/圧縮, 戸/雨戸, 甘/甘やかす and 編/編物; 温 also links the explicitly
taught 温まる/温める spellings to the new 暖まる/暖める articles.
The collection now contains 3,304 word articles. All 20 rows in this batch are review-closed.

### Initial review and reconciliation

Both reviewers independently read authored snapshot
`a0423388624ed50b0a348ad6f7dd7c212b3850b9` with the same assignment and evidence:
all 14 new articles, the actual ten-kanji/four-level-only diff and six narrow reuse claims.
The isolated `gpt-6.1-sol` process fully exited before `claude-opus-5.5` started.
Usage receipts verify those actual models and zero file edits; the author checked the clean
unchanged snapshot between runs.

Reports are archived without rewriting:
[GPT initial](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-02-gpt-initial.md) and
[Claude initial](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-02-claude-initial.md).
Both found the source mappings, related kanji passages and six reuse claims covered.

| Finding | Disposition | Evidence and change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT B02-GPT-01 / Claude B02-CL-01 | Resolved; confirmed | あてはめる and 適用 both teach applying a rule to a case. Add the direct guard and comparison link. This is one shared finding, not two independent defects. |
| GPT B02-GPT-02 | Resolved; confirmed | 宛名 explicitly includes the recipient's name alone. Add direct guards against 名前 and 名, plus a qualified comparison; the existing 名/名前 guard is not transitive. |
| Claude B02-CL-02 | Resolved; confirmed | あたりまえでしょう is taught as "of course," also もちろん's displayed label. Add that direct guard and link without claiming unrestricted grammatical substitution. |
| Claude B02-CL-03 | Guidance gap resolved; unsupported body preference withdrawn | Inspect the actual official 2014 PDF, entry 007, which covers both verbs as well as adjectives. Add qualified room/air versus food/drink spelling guidance and examples of 温. The body/hand spelling preference was not established by this source: replace those examples without declaring their former spelling wrong or asserting an exclusive body rule. |

The four direct quiz guards address localized answer ambiguity; they are treated as minor
editorial defects rather than general quiz failure. The spelling issue is missing contextual
guidance, not an established false dictionary spelling. The supplementary
`reviewEvidence` retains complete comparison entry families, the inspected PDF's hash,
exact location and the body/hand limitation.

**Optional, not blocking:** broader 危うい constructions/register, additional figurative overflow,
編み物 frequency guidance, あちらこちら register, a transitive title paraphrase and other prose polish.
No frequency claim is added from a dictionary spelling list alone. The 温 card's "also teaches"
links already identify the destination spelling; reversing that wording is not necessary for correctness.

**Model-usefulness note:** both found あてはめる/適用. GPT uniquely identified the two missing
recipient-name guards. Claude uniquely identified the "of course" label guard and the actionable
暖/温 guidance gap, while its proposed body-specific preference exceeded the inspected evidence.
These observations include the reports' optional notes and limits; they are shared-sample evidence
for complementary review signal, not a ranking or proof of exhaustive coverage.

### Changed-passage confirmation

Correction snapshot: `ae22a9861e76507bf8080c062b85a587c1ddaddd`, with the actual five-file
diff and each model's own initial report. Fresh bounded `gpt-6.1-sol` and `claude-opus-5.5`
processes ran sequentially on that unchanged clean snapshot and exited with zero file edits.
Both found all five changed article contexts **CLEAN / CLEAN / CLEAN** for correctness,
scoped coverage and comprehensibility; no actionable regression or consequential unresolved
claim remained in those passages.

[GPT confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-02-gpt-confirmation.md) resolves both original
GPT findings. [Claude confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-02-claude-confirmation.md)
resolves all three original Claude findings, explicitly withdraws the unverified body-spelling
guess and supports the additional 宛名 guards. Remaining suggestions about example sequencing,
kana presentation, explanatory wording and grammatical detail are optional, not new defects.
The body/hand preference remains unestablished but is no longer asserted by these cards.

Limits: file-only reviewers relied on author-verified snapshot/hash receipts and the supplied
short extract from the inspected official PDF; neither independently parsed that PDF or ran
the app. Closure is scoped editorial acceptance, not a native-speaker or whole-corpus guarantee.
The mechanical audit preserves all 3,273 baseline identities/readings/titles/exclusions and
established levels, separately recording the four source-backed formerly absent levels.
Validation reports zero errors; manifest generation is deterministic at `275a7b984b18b4c8`.
Coverage is **40 closed, 0 draft, 1,772 pending, 0 unresolved**: 31 new and nine reused articles.

## Batch 03: N2:42-N2:61

**Status:** review-closed after sequential changed-passage confirmation.

Scope: 荒い, 粗い, あらすじ, 争う, 改めて, 改める, 著す, 有難い, 在る,
あれこれ, あわただしい, あわてる, 安易, 案外, アンテナ, 言い出す, 言い付ける,
意義, 生き生き, いきなり.

The batch adds **19 articles** and reuses unchanged ある (N5), which already teaches the
source spelling 在る and the relevant existence/location meaning. It is not merged with
the separate lexical item 或. Original source wording and dictionary restrictions are retained
in the [batch evidence](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-03.json); neither a shared reading
nor the source's English "live" establishes an unrestricted human-residence definition.

Twelve existing kanji cards gain useful linked examples. Required reciprocal N2 links cover
荒/荒い, 改/改めて, 改/改める and 著/著す. The existing 戦う comparison gains a link
to 争う. No kanji metadata or stroke data changes. The actual PDF of the official 2014
異字同訓 guidance was inspected for entries 014-016; the packet records the hash, location,
brief extracts and inspection limits.

The collection contains 3,323 word articles. Coverage is **60 closed, 0 draft, 1,752 pending,
0 unresolved**: 50 new and ten reused articles overall. All 20 rows in this batch are closed.

### Initial review and reconciliation

Both reviewers independently assessed authored snapshot
`eabe2e942e8e6fa67cc4dd4093c3e6ea14edaf3c`, parent
`f8eaca3bef6d3c90b5002e0d3b50b206acc73d5d`, on the same unchanged clean worktree.
The short-lived `gpt-6.1-sol` process exited before `claude-opus-5.5` began.
Usage receipts verify those actual models and no file edits. Reports are archived verbatim:
[GPT initial](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-03-gpt-initial.md) and
[Claude initial](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-03-claude-initial.md).

All 19 new articles received separate correctness, scoped-coverage and comprehensibility
verdicts. Both also assessed the twelve-kanji/one-word related diff and the narrow unchanged
ある reuse claim. Neither established a defect in the source mappings or related edits.

| Initial observation | Decision and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| GPT B03-GPT-01 / Claude Optional: 粗い and かさかさ | Add a direct guard for their rough-texture answer overlap. Inspect complete entries 1396910 and 1037130 and the actual cards; the guard does not say that 粗い implies dryness. |
| GPT B03-GPT-02: 争う and 議論 | Add a direct guard for the documented dispute/argument use. Entry 1400620 sense 2 and entry 1226160 sense 1 support it; the existing 論争 relationships are not transitive. |
| GPT B03-GPT-03: 生き生き and もりもり/ばりばり | Add both direct energetic-activity guards. Entry 1609130 sense 1, 1012700 sense 2 and 1010340 sense 4 support the actual working/activity meanings, not just an energy-related topic. |
| Claude F1: 著す and 著者 | Add a direct guard for the English noun/verb label "author." Keep stable labels and the distinct Japanese roles; entries 1427080 and 1427110 do not make a person and an action grammatically interchangeable. |
| Claude F2: あわただしい and あわてる | Add a direct guard after checking the actual hurried/hurrying uses in entries 1278810 and 1278830. A common exclusion with 急ぐ is not itself evidence or transitive protection. |
| Claude F3: unexplained "source" references | Rewrite the three learner-facing passages in あわただしい, 安易 and 言い出す as direct spelling/meaning guidance. The public cards need no knowledge of the contributor's source CSV. |
| Claude F4 / GPT Optional: 徐々に navigation | Link the existing comparison article from いきなり. This is the same observation in both reports despite different severity. |

The six quiz pairs address localized English-answer ambiguity; no lexical definition or
existing card's stable identity, reading, title, exclusion list or easier level changes.
Complete comparison families from the pinned hash-verified JMdict bytes are retained in the
batch packet. The roughness and 徐々に observations are shared, not unique model discoveries.
GPT additionally found the dispute and two energetic-activity guards. Claude additionally
found the author-role and hurried-activity guards and the unclear source references.
This is useful complementary signal on one common sample, not a model ranking.

Optional expansions remain nonblocking: additional semantic ordering or examples, historical
derivation, 生きる navigation, clearer "usually written" wording and polishing 彼 explanations.
Claude's optional gratitude candidates were checked against the actual 御礼 and ありがとう
cards and complete entry families. They teach related thanks or thanking expressions, but
that alone does not establish another missing direct answer-label guard for "grateful;
appreciated"; no additional defect is claimed or exclusion inferred through 感謝.

Initial-review limits remain explicit: neither reviewer ran Git, recomputed frozen hashes
or executed the app; both relied on the author-inspected official PDF extract. GPT's independent
live Jisho checks are JMdict-derived, not an independent dictionary tradition. Claude's
naturalness impressions for two constructions are not native-speaker certification; no contrary
evidence or consequential unresolved claim was established in the practical teaching scope.
GPT disclosed an incidental one-row TSV overread, which it did not assess or use.

### Changed-passage confirmation and closure

Correction snapshot: `f1bd2eb788772ddeb743f32cd818bb9b3d896081`, parent
`eabe2e942e8e6fa67cc4dd4093c3e6ea14edaf3c`. Both original model families received
the same actual eight-word correction diff, their own original report and the same bounded
evidence access. Fresh short-lived processes ran sequentially: GPT fully exited before Claude
started. Usage receipts confirm `gpt-6.1-sol`, `claude-opus-5.5` and zero file edits.

[GPT confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-03-gpt-confirmation.md) resolves B03-GPT-01
through B03-GPT-03, including both energetic-activity pairs, and confirms its optional 徐々に
link was implemented. [Claude confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-03-claude-confirmation.md)
resolves F1-F4 and confirms its optional roughness guard was implemented.
Each report accepts all six direct pairs and all eight changed contexts as
**CLEAN / CLEAN / CLEAN**. Neither establishes an actionable regression or consequential
unresolved claim within the assigned scope.

Claude's remaining warning-context wording, gratitude candidates, 生きる link and other
initial optional expansions remain nonblocking; confirmation does not turn them into defects.
No full-batch rereview or independent PDF/app execution is claimed. The initial full-article
assessments and bounded confirmations jointly support closure, with their file-only snapshot
and linguistic-certification limits preserved.

The author separately verified all 3,273 baseline identities/readings/titles/exclusions and
established levels, source/index integrity, twelve cumulative reciprocal N2 word pairs and
`stop-cran` authorship. The validator reports zero errors and repeated manifest generation is
deterministic at `ebc4e3f59c4d7584`. Source rows and the packet are now marked closed.

## Batch 04: N2:62-N2:81

**Status:** review-closed after sequential changed-passage and supplementary confirmation.

Scope: 育児, 幾分, 生け花, 以後, 以降, イコール, 勇ましい, 衣食住,
意地悪, いちいち, 一応, 一段, 一流, 佚, 一昨日, 一昨年, 一斉, 一旦,
一定, いってらっしゃい.

The batch adds **18 articles** and reuses the unchanged N5 一昨日 and 一昨年.
Both existing articles already explicitly teach the source on-readings
いっさくじつ and いっさくねん. Their primary native readings and levels remain
unchanged. The collection contains 3,341 word articles.
Three existing N2 kanji pages gain useful reciprocal word links:
児/育児, 勇/勇ましい, and 衣/衣食住.

The [batch evidence](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-04.json) preserves every
original field and complete relevant dictionary family. Source row N2:75 is
the noun 佚/いつ, not the unrelated N5 question word いつ. Its supplied gloss
resembles character meanings and does not match the supplied lexical entry.
The article teaches the noun established by pinned JMdict and the inspected
Seisenban Nihon Kokugo Daijiten entry, with a classical expression actually
found in Koji Seigo o Shiru Jiten. No modern frequency claim is inferred.
The blank original gloss for いってらっしゃい also remains blank in provenance.

Selected practical senses, spelling/reading restrictions, qualified temporal
boundaries, and direct quiz guards were independently reviewed. An authored
commit or successful structural check alone does not establish review closure.

### Initial review and reconciliation

Common frozen snapshot: `a14eb7276298c2231ac00aa70cea55948bb3e7fc`, parent
`760cf55d180e2ce3105ea569f9443632c653408c`. The same 18 articles, three
changed kanji contexts and two unchanged reuse claims were assigned to fresh
isolated `gpt-6.1-sol` and `claude-opus-5.5` processes. GPT fully exited before
Claude started, with no intervening repository edits. Usage receipts confirm
the actual models and zero file edits. Both [GPT](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-04-gpt-initial.md)
and [Claude](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-04-claude-initial.md) reports are archived
verbatim; neither initial reviewer saw the other report or author reconciliation.

The author checked the actual comparison articles and complete hash-verified
dictionary families before accepting direct guards:

| Initial observation | Decision and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| GPT04-01 / Claude F1: 幾分 reading classification | Resolve with the established native-first `wago` grouping and mixed-reading tag, explicitly explaining native いく + on ブン. KANJIDIC2 and the existing 場所 treatment support this; it is not a claim that both readings are native. |
| GPT04-02: 幾分 / 気持ち | Add a direct guard for 気持ち's ordinary slight-degree sense (entry 1591430, sense 4), not its unrelated feeling sense. |
| GPT04-03 / Claude F4: temporal cards / 来 | Add separate direct guards on both 以後 and 以降 for the "since" label taught by 来, entry 1547710 sense 2. Claude flagged 以降; GPT also flagged 以後. |
| GPT04-04 / Claude Optional: イコール / 同一 and 同様 | Add both direct equal/equivalent-label guards, supported by entries 1451900 and 1453550 sense 1. They were shared observations despite different severity labels. |
| GPT04-05: いちいち / あらゆる | Add a direct guard for the every-single/every label overlap, entries 1587320 sense 2 and 1586780 sense 1; keep the different attachment forms. |
| GPT04-06 / Claude F5: 一応 / およそ | Add the direct rough-assessment/roughly-label guard, entries 1161170 sense 1 and 1523450. Existing 大体 protection is not transitive. |
| Claude F5: 一応 / 約 and ほぼ | Add both guards after checking actual approximation titles and entries 1538100 sense 1 and 1551940 sense 2. Keep the valid "roughly" title rather than relabel it to disguise English-answer ambiguity. The guards do not turn 一応 into a general numerical estimator. |
| GPT04-07 / Claude F6 and Optional: 一流 / 上等 and 優秀 | Add two direct quality-evaluation guards, supported by entries 1354030 and 1539230 sense 1. 上等 was shared under Findings and 優秀 was shared across Findings/Optional. |
| GPT04-08: 佚 / ゆっくり | Add a direct guard for the leisure/rest use in entry 1013050 senses 1/3, not every slow-speed use. |
| Claude F2: 衣食住 collective gloss | Change the new title to "food, clothing and shelter," matching the heading and entry 1158780, rather than suggest independent alternative definitions separated by a semicolon. |
| Claude F3: comparison navigation | Add five missing link occurrences across 育児, 以後, 以降, 衣食住 and 一定, targeting the four existing cards 教育, 以前, 生活 and 変化. |
| Claude Optional: イコール / 平等 | Add a guard for the context-free equal/equality labels after checking actual equal-treatment/distribution teaching and entry 1507670 sense 1. This is not a claim that mathematical identity and equal treatment are identical concepts. |
| Claude Optional: 一斉 / 一緒 | Add a guard after verifying 一緒's ordinary same-time sense, entry 1163400 sense 4, as well as its actual together-action title. |
| Claude Optional: 一定 / 安定 | Add a guard for the fixed/constant versus stable-state answer overlap, entries 1164950 sense 2 and 1154120 senses 1/2. It does not impose exact numerical constancy on every 安定 situation. |
| Claude Optional: 一定 / 常に | No additional guard established: the inspected entry 1355970 and actual card concern always/constantly as frequency or continuity, not the fixed or prescribed value described by 一定. A related constancy theme alone does not establish another interchangeable answer label. |

The correction changes twelve new articles, adding fifteen direct quiz pairs,
five comparison links, one collective title correction and an explicit
native-first reading explanation. It preserves every baseline identity,
primary reading, title, exclusion list and established level. Complete newly
needed comparison families are retained in the packet; dictionary presence
is not itself a pairing decision.

The models supplied useful complementary signal on this common sample:
both caught the mixed reading, 来 on 以降, approximation and quality guards;
同一/同様 and 優秀 are shared even though Claude called them Optional.
GPT uniquely proposed 気持ち, 来 on 以後, あらゆる and ゆっくり.
Claude uniquely proposed the collective title fix, missing comparison links,
約/ほぼ and the additional 平等/一緒/安定 candidates.
No ranking or general model-performance conclusion follows from one batch.

Other optional collocation, register, polite-greeting and kanji-stem expansions
remain nonblocking and are not used to extend unchanged cards' review scope.
Both initial reviewers independently retrieved the relevant Kotobank
temporal and 佚 entries. GPT also retrieved Jisho comparison entries; that
is independent retrieval of JMdict-derived data, not another dictionary
tradition. Neither executed Git, recomputed hashes or ran the app. Claude's
wrong 一定 lookup is explicitly not evidence; the article's の/suru patterns
remain supported by the pinned dictionary. Naturalness judgments are not
native-speaker certification.

### Changed-passage confirmation

Correction snapshot: `68380b7c43f3dc42c56f88e5639b525357dd4e85`, parent
`a14eb7276298c2231ac00aa70cea55948bb3e7fc`. Fresh original-family processes
ran sequentially on the unchanged corrected commit, with their own initial
reports and the actual twelve-file diff. Usage receipts verify `gpt-6.1-sol`,
`claude-opus-5.5` and zero file edits. Both reports are archived verbatim:
[GPT confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-04-gpt-confirmation.md) and
[Claude confirmation](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-04-claude-confirmation.md).
Both accept all twelve changed contexts and fifteen direct pairs as
**CLEAN / CLEAN / CLEAN**, with no actionable regression or consequential
unresolved claim in scope. They resolve their original findings and independently
support leaving the frequency adverb 常に unguarded against 一定.

Claude's optional confirmation notes identify two further approximation-label
candidates, くらい and ほど. Their actual cards and complete pinned entries
1154340 sense 1 and 1436510 sense 6 support cautious direct guards against
一応's "roughly" label. Different syntax and fewer shared candidate-selection
features do not eliminate fallback answer-label ambiguity. These two pairs
are added in a separate one-file follow-up; they do not turn 一応 into a
general numerical approximation particle or alter either baseline card.
They receive the supplementary changed-passage confirmation recorded below.

Other confirmation suggestions about 幾分 wording and teaching 気持ち's
additional adverb sense remain optional. Neither report independently verifies
Git, frozen hashes or app execution; no new full-batch review is claimed.

### Supplementary confirmation and closure

Supplementary snapshot: `dd4d6de435d91c2ab362a89660d97b173a9cf8d1`, parent
`68380b7c43f3dc42c56f88e5639b525357dd4e85`. The actual one-line diff
adds only the two 一応/くらい and 一応/ほど guards. Fresh `gpt-6.1-sol`
and `claude-opus-5.5` processes reviewed that same unchanged commit
sequentially, with each model's own reports and the same bounded evidence.
Usage receipts confirm actual models and zero file edits. Their verbatim
[GPT supplement](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-04-gpt-supplement.md) and
[Claude supplement](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-04-claude-supplement.md)
both accept correctness, scoped coverage and comprehensibility as **CLEAN**.
No actionable regression or consequential unresolved claim remains in scope.
Claude explicitly withdraws its earlier optional retitling alternative;
English-label ambiguity should not be hidden by cosmetic rewording.

The eighteen initial whole-article reviews, three related kanji-context
assessments, two unchanged reuse checks, twelve-file confirmations and
one-line supplementary confirmations jointly support this batch's closure.
All six reports retain their file-only snapshot/hash and app-execution
limits; scoped acceptance is not native-speaker certification or an
exhaustive whole-corpus semantic guarantee.

The author separately verified all 3,273 baseline identities, readings,
titles, exclusion lists and established levels, exact source/index
integrity, fifteen cumulative reciprocal N2 word pairs and `stop-cran`
authorship. The seventeen correction pairs preserve all baseline metadata.
Validation reports zero errors and repeated manifest generation is
deterministic at `8d6cfcd10efadd70`. Coverage is **80 closed, 0 draft,
1,732 pending, 0 unresolved**: 68 new and twelve reused articles overall.
The collection contains 3,341 word articles; all twenty batch rows and the
evidence packet are marked closed.

## Batch 05: N2:82-N2:101

**Status:** initial reviews complete; corrections committed before bounded confirmation.

The twenty rows add **nineteen articles**: いってまいります, いつのまにか,
移転, 井戸, 緯度, 従姉妹, 威張る, 嫌がる, いよいよ, 煎る,
入れ物, インキ, インタビュー, 引力, ウーマン, ウール, ウェイトレス,
植木, 飢える. Source 煎る and 炒る explicitly share the cooking article;
neither maps to the unrelated existing existence verb いる.

The [evidence packet](n2-vocabulary-batch-sources/batch-05.json) retains
the original source fields, complete relevant families, exact sense mappings,
component records and complete comparison families. Source ウエートレス
maps to primary dictionary reading ウェイトレス with explicit search-variant
teaching; the original form remains unchanged in provenance. The departing
speaker's formal greeting is distinguished from the send-off reply, and the
female-cousin article preserves the whole-word reading いとこ.

Three N2 kanji pages gain reciprocal links: 移/移転, 戸/井戸, 植/植木.
Existing 従兄弟 and インク gain narrowly related comparison links.
No baseline identity, primary reading, title, exclusion list or sourced
level changes. The collection contains 3,360 word articles.

Actual Digital Daijisen entries for 煎る and 炒める support the qualified
cooking comparison. The failed initial search endpoint and an unsupported
always-without-oil search-summary claim are not treated as evidence.
No review-closed status is claimed for these twenty drafted rows.

### Initial review

Both reviewers examined the same unchanged clean authored snapshot
`7cc99e2535f9e4ac917278a5b4f2e49db954e4fa`, parent
`5a85c2bc96780a9d2fdb2df0e64d33887bbb7902`, with identical scope,
rubric and source access. Separate short-lived processes ran sequentially:
GPT exited before Claude started. Usage receipts verify actual models
`gpt-6.1-sol` and `claude-opus-5.5` and zero file edits.

The verbatim [GPT report](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-05-gpt-initial.md)
finds no actionable defect. The verbatim
[Claude report](n2-vocabulary-reviews/batch-05-claude-initial.md) makes
four localized recommendations in three new articles. Both assess all nineteen
articles, the five existing-card passages and the explicit alias mappings;
neither claims comprehensive review of unchanged comparison cards.

### Reconciliation

| Initial observation | Decision and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Claude R1: いつのまにか/こっそり English-answer ambiguity | Add the direct exclusion. Actual titles overlap through "unnoticed"/"without being noticed"; complete entries 1188850 and 1004520 distinguish observer unawareness from secret action without removing that English-label ambiguity. |
| Claude R2: unexplained departure/secrecy sentence | Replace the dangling departure reference with a named, linked こっそり comparison. Explain the contrast directly without asserting that an unnoticed event must be secret or that the Japanese adverbs substitute unrestrictedly. |
| Claude R3: "Uman" obscures vowel length | Keep ウーマン itself in the English translation. The existing long-vowel explanation remains unchanged; no competing romanization convention is introduced. |
| Claude R4: missing practical インキ/インク usage guidance | Add qualified consumer stationery/home-printer versus printing-industry terminology guidance. Actual T&K TOKA and Printing/Binding Terminology Online Dictionary pages corroborate the convention. Do not adopt a blanket ban on プリンターのインキ, measured frequency, unverified historical dating, or a material-composition boundary. |

The added complete comparison family and exact external inspections are
retained in the evidence packet. The search response contained inconsistent
alternate URLs; those were not treated as evidence. Only actually fetched,
relevant pages support the usage note. The separate インキ article is
justified by its distinct source entry, not by inventing a different
substance or requiring an absolute register split.

Claude's optional expansion candidates remain nonblocking: additional
いよいよ senses, a 鉢 gloss or 植木鉢 example, another 戸 voicing note,
additional cousin spellings and reciprocal インク usage guidance. Its
tentative えばる register and ウエートレス frequency suggestions were
not verified and are not promoted into teaching claims.

**Model-usefulness note:** the three correction groups are unique
to Claude in this sample, including comparison against GPT's Optional
and Limits sections. R1 and R2 concern the same comparison, affecting
the quiz and explanation respectively; they are not counted as two
independent discoveries. Both independently support the alias mappings,
component links and qualified cooking contrast. This is useful
complementary coverage, not a general ranking or a reason to adjudicate
future disagreements by model identity.

Bounded confirmation is still required for the three changed contexts.
The initial whole-article verdicts alone do not close the twenty rows.

## Final verification

Not started. Final closure requires all original rows accounted for, no consequential unresolved
claims, independent review coverage of every addition and changed passage, baseline preservation,
source/reading/sense and cross-reference audits, a deterministic manifest, and `stop-cran` authorship.
