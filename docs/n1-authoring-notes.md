# N1 kanji expansion

## Frozen scope

[Issue #60](https://github.com/stop-cran/learning-japanese/issues/60) authorizes the
kanji-only expansion: **1,228 additions**, necessary supporting word articles and
the specified review, native-acceptance and publication gates. It does not
authorize the separate N1 vocabulary, grammar or listening projects.

The [source snapshot](n1-source-snapshot.json) pins the actual implementation
downloads, including JMdict created **2026-11-02** and Unicode **17.0.0**.
The [raw community response](n1-sources/community-list-20261102.json) contains
1,232 distinct characters. Preserve existing 士・奇・怪・訳 and the separately
documented 妖 exception. Expected final counts remain 2,213 kanji / 1,233
N1-labelled cards, absent explicitly reconciled intervening changes.

The immutable [baseline inventory](n1-sources/baseline-inventory.json) records
all 985 kanji, 4,942 word articles and 985 stroke files at
`57dcc2aaedd8d6b0f141d5b4c3cb9c13f6f797b2`, including full card metadata,
Git blob identities and SHA-256 hashes of repository bytes. Its complete
baseline manifest also pins other runtime content. Existing bodies remain
available at that Git commit; inventory hashes are not a linguistic review.

The [source index](n1-sources/source-index.json) preserves source order, full
on/kun metadata order, radical mappings, stroke-count annotations and canonical
KanjiVG SVG blob identities. All 1,228 additions are **pending** at this freeze.
The index's `statusAtFreeze` and `assignedBatchAtFreeze` are historical, not
mutable completion counters. Later batch source/review records must distinguish
pending, drafted and review-closed states and record published SHAs separately.
No card is review-closed or published by this preparation checkpoint.

[Selected KANJIDIC2 records](n1-sources/kanjidic2-selected.xml) retain the complete
parsed character records for every source member plus 妖, including fields not
transported into teaching metadata. XML is reserialized, not a byte-identical
slice of the original compressed dictionary. The snapshot pins both original
compressed and decompressed hashes. Raw dictionary downloads remain outside
runtime content and outside Git; selected complete applicable JMdict families
will be retained in each batch before lexical authoring.

## Pilot

The frozen [12-character pilot](n1-sources/pilot-membership.json) is
**幹・氏・扱・乃・凹・凸・矛・鷹・彗・漱・栞・莉**. Its assignments deliberately
mix existing-compound reuse, bound forms, primary-reading identity risks,
many/source-only readings, grade-9/name-use classification, the source's maximum
stroke count and four system-font-fallback characters. These are inspection
assignments, not findings about modern frequency or usable name readings.
Split the pilot further if its complete evidence becomes too large.

The [810 declared candidate pairs](n1-sources/baseline-word-candidates.json)
cover 757 baseline word articles and 490 missing characters. They are
**unverified candidates**, not established support mappings or required new
article counts. Inspect exact spellings, primary readings, full dictionary
families and restrictions before reuse; search kana-headed articles as well.
Activated links and reciprocal pairs must cover reused articles too.

The [font inventory](n1-sources/font-coverage.json) independently reproduces all
40 characters absent from all three bundled kanji-font cmaps at Android
`2bc0234bffcb3c4a0cbafde80367d24d2638a93a`. Every native-inspection disposition is
still pending. Cmap absence is neither a missing-glyph finding nor evidence of
successful native fallback. No phone or emulator smoke test has run.

The [mutable pilot ledger](n1-sources/pilot-progress.json) now records all
**12 cards as drafted, none review-closed**. Twelve pinned stroke files were
generated without geometry edits; all counts match the frozen metadata.
Fourteen reciprocal pairs span eight reused and five new word articles,
including the kana-headed でこぼこ and うがい articles. Existing primary readings,
levels, titles and exclusions are preserved. In particular, 凹む remains
**へこむ**, and the separate くぼむ example is not linked as though it shared
that identity. New support articles are **乃至・鷹・彗星・栞・茉莉花**; no word
JLPT level is inferred from a character's N1 membership.

The [40-family lexical packet](n1-sources/pilot-jmdict.xml) preserves complete
selected JMdict entries, not only chosen glosses. Its
[selection](n1-sources/pilot-lexical-selection.json) and
[inspection record](n1-sources/pilot-external-evidence.json) document restrictions
and lookup limits. Eleven additional complete comparison families and five
broad-label families are preserved in
[comparison](n1-sources/pilot-comparisons-jmdict.xml) and
[label](n1-sources/pilot-label-jmdict.xml) packets. All **56 families** were
inspected by the author, not independent reviewers. The older suffix -うじ is
illustrated from an inspected Japanese dictionary and contrasted with modern
し. Kanjipedia's returned character-page headings independently establish the
written boundaries of 漱ぐ くちすすぐ and 漱ぐ すすぐ; blank word-page
extractions are explicitly not counted as inspected definitions. An attempted
radical-number inference from an image filename was removed after inspection of
the actual glyph. Historical analysis is not inferred from that image.

All **47 metadata readings** have draft dispositions and explicit table rows.
Fifteen remain qualified source-only entries, without manufactured compounds
or personal-name readings. Direct exclusions on new support articles protect
their overlapping alternative/book/bird/flower labels; baseline exclusions
remain untouched. These are author-side safeguards awaiting independent review.

The ledger records the source-order offered-key projection for all twelve
characters against the actual Android reading adapter and queue implementation.
氏's うじ/-うじ entries collapse to one offered stem; uncommon/source-only
readings elsewhere are **not** filtered by article prose. Twelve source-only
keys remain within the **41 projected offered keys**, including 扱 ソウ/キュウ,
彗 エ/ケイ, 栞 カン and 莉 ライ/レイ. The ledger enumerates every one.
Complete reading acceptance and any narrow issue-#1 prerequisite remain
unresolved. No metadata was silently dropped or reordered to alter the quiz.

The draft has five new support articles for twelve characters, not a forecast
of the entire expansion. With a 12-character pilot and later batches capped
at 15, the planning floor becomes **83 total batches / 166 initial reviewer
assignments**, before necessary splits or confirmations. Footprint, support
and effort estimates must be recalibrated after independent corrections and
pilot acceptance; the present local measurements do not authorize full rollout.

Both future independent reviewers must cover every pilot card, all new support
articles and changed reused passages on the same frozen teaching snapshot,
including correctness, scoped coverage and phone comprehensibility. No model
identity or content review has yet been obtained; planning is not content review.
The first attempt to capture the installed CLI's `--help` was permission-denied
before execution. That historical receipt is unchanged. The parent subsequently
supplied successful installed `copilot --help` and `copilot help config`
captures in the external control inputs. They document `--model`,
`--session-id`, `--available-tools` and named GPT/Claude models, resolving catalog
discovery only. No reviewer has run and no actual reviewer identity is claimed.

## Reproduction and next work

From this dedicated content worktree, with the approved downloads in the
external control input directory and the clean pinned sibling Android tree:

```powershell
python -X utf8 -B tools\freeze_n1_sources.py --inputs C:\Users\stop-\n1-kanji-workspace\control\inputs --android C:\Users\stop-\n1-kanji-workspace\kanji-cards-android --check
```

The authoring helper requires PyYAML and fontTools. It verifies all source
hashes, exact baseline counts, membership, reading workloads, candidate-pair
counts and font cmaps. Without `--check`, it only creates missing identical
freeze outputs and refuses to replace different evidence. It does not download,
rewrite cards, choose teaching readings or certify linguistic correctness.
Contributor evidence and tools remain excluded from downloadable runtime ZIPs.

The lexical packet is reproducible with the frozen dictionary:

```powershell
python -X utf8 -B tools\extract_n1_jmdict.py --input C:\Users\stop-\n1-kanji-workspace\control\inputs\n1-implementation-JMdict_e.gz --selection docs\n1-sources\pilot-lexical-selection.json --output docs\n1-sources\pilot-jmdict.xml --check
```

The extractor verifies the frozen compressed hash, preserves every selected
family in full with expanded entity descriptions, and refuses different existing
output. It is not a linguistic review. Repeat with
`pilot-comparison-selection.json` / `pilot-comparisons-jmdict.xml` and
`pilot-label-selection.json` / `pilot-label-jmdict.xml` for the additional packets.

The complete draft has a separate reproducible mechanical audit:

```powershell
python -X utf8 -B tools\audit_n1_pilot.py
```

It compares every baseline card/word metadata record and original stroke hash,
all unrelated baseline manifest entries, exact pilot additions, every source
metadata reading/table row, actual source-order key projections, all activated
baseline candidate pairs, all selected reciprocal pairs and manifest freshness.
It does not establish semantic correctness, execute Kotlin, inspect native
fonts or approve a source-only quiz key. The
[draft audit output](n1-sources/pilot-draft-audit.json) and
[execution receipt](n1-sources/execution-003.json) preserve this checkpoint.

Next: freeze the exact complete teaching snapshot and obtain the two serial
independent reviews, without supplying the author's prior quiz/review rationale
or another reviewer's findings. Give both the same actual teaching, full
dictionary packets and neutral source observations. Native/phone acceptance,
all-40-font inspection, an explicit reading/prerequisite disposition, updated
estimates and pilot publication remain separate gates. Do not start full rollout
or push these unreviewed drafts.
